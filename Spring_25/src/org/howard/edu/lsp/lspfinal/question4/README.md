# Design Pattern Discussion

While design patterns are incredibly useful in promoting flexibility and reuse, there are definitely situations where using one can actually be a disadvantage. One example we discussed in Lecture 11 and directly in the Design Pattern Introduction presentation is when a pattern adds unnecessary complexity to a simple design. The slide titled "The Downside" explicitly states that while patterns promote flexibility, it may come "at the expense of a more complicated design."

For instance, if you're working on a small application with a single, unchanging behavior, applying something like the Strategy pattern just to "future-proof" the code can actually make things worse. It adds extra classes, interfaces, and abstraction layers that complicate the code without providing real benefit in that context.

This ties back to a principle we covered in Lecture 11, 12 and the Lecture Interfaces Patterns presentation is the KISS principle: "Keep It Simple, Stupid". That lecture also emphasized design clarity and simplicity through checklists on class design (cohesion, clarity, convenience) and overall strategies like minimizing interdependencies. Overusing patterns in simple scenarios violates these principles and can lead to bloated, harder-to-maintain code.

So while patterns are powerful tools, our lectures and their associated presentations stressed the importance of using them thoughtfully. Just because a pattern exists doesn't mean it's always the right fit as it should solve a real problem without overcomplicating the design.
